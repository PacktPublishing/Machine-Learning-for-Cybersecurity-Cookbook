**Implement smart AI systems for preventing cyber attacks and detecting threats and network anomalies**

## What is this book about?
Organizations today face a major threat in terms of cybersecurity, from malicious URLs to credential reuse, and having robust security systems can make all the difference. With this book, you'll learn how to use Python libraries such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn to implement the latest artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and handle challenges faced by cybersecurity researchers.


This book covers the following exciting features:
Learn how to build malware classifiers to detect suspicious activities 
Apply ML to generate custom malware to pentest your security 
Use ML algorithms with complex datasets to implement cybersecurity concepts 
Create neural networks to identify fake videos and images 
Secure your organization from one of the most popular threats – insider threats 
Defend against zero-day threats by constructing an anomaly detection system 
Detect web vulnerabilities effectively by combining Metasploit and ML 
Understand how to train a model without exposing the training data
