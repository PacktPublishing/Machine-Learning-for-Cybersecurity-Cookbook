Ironically, I hope we’re never on the list!. @Dc_Nawfel @universal_sci v^2/r is fun haha. @universal_sci Makes it clear that you can only sense acceleration, not velocity. @TheOnion The downward spiral …. @kalinizaurus @wylsacom Good point. @JCobrae To carry 7 people. Model S at Nürburgring has 7 seats. @ThePhoenixFlare @PPathole @flcnhvy @Sofiaan @emicimaz All great! ♥️ Mel Brooks. @PPathole @flcnhvy @Sofiaan @emicimaz Spaceballs. @flcnhvy @Sofiaan @emicimaz Flux capacitor option package. @Sofiaan @emicimaz Yes. @MKBHD Soon. @emicimaz Yes. To be clear, Plaid powertrain is about a year away from production &amp; applies to S,X &amp; Roadster, but not 3 or Y. Will cost more than our current offerings, but less than competitors.. @annerajb No. The only thing beyond Ludicrous is Plaid. @v_g_fischer @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @nichegamer A Flock of Bricks. @MKBHD @alistairmilne Next year. RT @fermatslibrary: The Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation derived by the Russian schoolteacher Tsiolkovsky in 1898 describes how rockets move in…. @RenataKonkoly @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @nichegamer Cuphead. @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy @nichegamer Of course. @flcnhvy @nichegamer Polytopia. @nichegamer This could be good. @alistairmilne But we probably won’t try for best lap time this week, as we need to review &amp; tune Model S thoroughly for safety on Nürburgring, especially Flugplatz section. @alistairmilne Model S is already there. Model S just set record for fastest 4 door ever at Laguna Seca, video tmrw. @hanktheskank34 @joerogan 🤣🤣. DMT FTW  https://urlzs.com/u8ZB …. @mortchad @TheOnion I’d love to. obv. .@TheOnion is my thought bubble. @TheOnion @tim_cook 👍. @kimpaquette @Tesla For sure!. ♥️♥️🇮🇸🇮🇸 Ísland 🇮🇸🇮🇸♥️♥️  https://urlzs.com/u8ZB \\n\\nIf the driver does not respond to attention prompts, the…. @tesla_truth Exactly. @kierank_ @Teslarati Looks good. @MemesOfMars @Teslarati The mechanical attachment mechanism. We need to make sure they won’t fall off due to vibration &amp; acoustics.. @nate_mccomb @Teslarati 48 61 20 68 61. @Teslarati The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal.. @Erdayastronaut @JHC2718 @MagnussonMani @vicvic21266 @flcnhvy @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Failure rate is actually both higher &amp; lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate.. @Erdayastronaut @IvanEscobosa @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Precisely. @Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven’t moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you’ll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox &amp; fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you’re prob ok.. @Erdayastronaut @vicvic21266 @flcnhvy @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric 🤣🤣. @flcnhvy @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric You know destination weather before departure &amp; there’s no weather in space. @flcnhvy @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Everything happens so fast. It’s such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins.. @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell &amp; fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull.. @Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but that’s not indicative of capability.. @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @DJSnM @spaceXcentric Over time, 355 &amp; 385 are possible, but very difficult. @SpaceXFan97 @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @DJSnM @spaceXcentric Most likely. @EvaFoxU @justpaulinelol @flcnhvy @tarimnazmi Photoshop is amazing. @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @DJSnM @spaceXcentric Sea level Raptor’s vacuum Isp is ~350 sec, but ~380 sec with larger vacuum-optimized nozzle. @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @tarimnazmi For sure. @justpaulinelol Actually true. @flcnhvy @tarimnazmi Ceres, Callisto, Ganymede &amp; Titan. And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest  https://urlzs.com/u8ZB ’re in base Polytopia is highly unlikely - KWM. @MikeHudema @GretaThunberg Wow cool. Why aren’t more people talking about this!?  https://urlzs.com/u8ZB …. @flcnhvy @WorldAndScience Sounds about right. @WorldAndScience It’s not. @meamZ_MZ @widespreadcha0s @HeyMarkL @Tesla Over time, it will be 100% sustainable. Hadouken!!  https://urlzs.com/u8ZB \\U0001f970 -- Went from 19% to 60% I kid you not in j…. @RenataKonkoly Offer me money, offer me power …  https://urlzs.com/u8ZB ’s rapid progress in space! There are always setbacks, of course, but I think India is doing great overall.. @RenataKonkoly @HarryStoltz1 @teslaownersSV @tesla_truth @Tesla Yes. @nico_rosberg Thanks for offering! Sure, that would be great.. @flcnhvy @annerajb @brandonbernicky @Gfilche @teslaownersSV @tesla_truth @Tesla We might be in one right now. @IvanEscobosa @annerajb @brandonbernicky @Gfilche @teslaownersSV @tesla_truth @Tesla No, probably V10.1. @annerajb @brandonbernicky @Gfilche @teslaownersSV @tesla_truth @Tesla Merging code branches &amp; one more QA-level release this week. Hopefully, EAP wide release week after.. @brandonbernicky @Gfilche @teslaownersSV @tesla_truth @Tesla Looking good. Smart summon is almost great. Drive-in theater mode, caraoke &amp; Cuphead are awesome.. @Gfilche @teslaownersSV @tesla_truth @Tesla \\U0001f973. @HarryStoltz1 @teslaownersSV @tesla_truth @Tesla For sure on first crewed missions for exactly that reason. @teslaownersSV @tesla_truth @Tesla Wanted to build an electric car company in college. Was going to do PhD at Stanford in electric energy storage (ultracaps), but got distracted for a few years by the Internet.. @tesla_truth @Tesla 10 years ago …. @vincent13031925 @Eljaboom November most likely. @Eljaboom We’re almost there. Tesla doing laps at Nerdburgering  https://urlzs.com/u8ZB ürburgring track time is great.. @newscientist Sounds sweaty  https://urlzs.com/u8ZB 😲.

Model S on Nürburgring next week. @Jalopnik @Porsche Also, cars are called “automobiles”. @Jalopnik @Porsche Jalopnik not sharpest tool in shed …\\n https://urlzs.com/u8ZB 🤣🤣. Um @Porsche, this word Turbo does not mean what you think it does. @ethelreddy1 @Tesla Looking into it. @WillyTHodgkins Yes, and it ♥️♥️♥️ irony. @TeslaTrip Still too buggy to be in wide EAP. Requires more testing. Hopefully, going to wide EAP next week.. @thbo It’s up to 🇳🇴 &amp; 🇳🇱 as to whether they go with EU rules or rest of world. Not our choice.. @justpaulinelol @Tesla Same, except where limited by EU regulations. We’re aware of extreme consumer unhappiness about this &amp; are working with EU regulators to address.. @Tesla In close traffic, poisonous gas spewing from the car in front of you goes straight into your AC intake. Good thing gas/diesel carmakers didn’t cheat on their emissions or we’d be in real trouble 😅. @nichegamer Nice. @konrad_bilinski Gasoline is designed to burn. @ElecVehicleGuy @Tesla Anywhere insurance prices are high. @Sofiaan @flcnhvy @coolsilver @Tesla Yeah, several. Smart Summon most significant.. @flcnhvy @coolsilver @Tesla Both 🍀 and 😋 buttons in V10.0. @teslaownersSV @tesla_truth Yup. @coolsilver @Tesla Yes. @tesla_truth Definitely. Try Tesla Insurance. Should be ~20% less than avg. Currently only in California, but expanding soon.
